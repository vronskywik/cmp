Labour currently lead the Conservatives in polling by double-digit figures. </p><p>In June, Labour said it would aim to reach that level by the middle of a five-year term in office, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07523b2d-5d44-4015-8076-b0196c420ba8\">first dilution</a> of what had previously been a more immediate commitment.</p><p>The party figures added that the £28bn commitment now included existing government capital spending on green schemes, which experts said was currently around £8bn a year.</p><p>The incorporation of existing spending could reduce the amount of additional borrowing to £20bn a year under Labour’s proposals.</p><p>One Labour party official said it was too early to give a definitive figure for the future: “We wouldn’t put a number on it now because we need to see the final books after the election,” they said.</p><p>They also noted UK borrowing costs had risen since the pledge was first made in 2021 and said Labour had been clear any spending would need to comply with its target to reduce debt as a share of national income after five years.</p><p>Labour said: “We have said that we will ramp up to £28bn of investment in the second half of the parliament. Government spending is chopping and changing in this area all the time.”</p><p>“It will only be possible to finalise our plans once we know what projects we will inherit and the state of the public finances,” it added.</p><p>Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, signalled the further watering down to Labour’s proposals on Monday on the BBC, referencing projects “the government is already spending money on” and adding “this is not all additional money”.</p><p>Until June, Labour had portrayed the £28bn number as “additional” expenditure.</p><p>One shadow minister said that Labour would also increasingly emphasise the phrase “up to £28bn”, further weakening the target.</p><p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies, the financial think-tank, said recently that the Conservative government had already pencilled in £8bn of emissions-reducing capital spending for 2024-5.</p><p>“To spend £28bn per year on the green transition therefore requires ‘only’ £20bn to be added to existing plans,” it said <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/articles/look-under-hood-labours-investment-plans\">in September</a>.</p><p>The IFS also observed that the pledge was in nominal cash terms: “If expressed in terms of today’s prices, it would be less.”</p><p>Even incorporating current spending, the IFS report calculated that Labour’s plans amounted to public sector net investment of 2.6 per cent of GDP over five years, which was 60 per cent higher than the average for the last 45 years.<br/></p></body>","title":"Labour cuts back £28bn green investment pledge again","standfirst":"UK opposition party pushes
